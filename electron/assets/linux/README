samos
=======


The samos client binary uses a localhost http interface for its GUI.
By default it runs on http://127.0.0.1:12176.  This is configurable with

    --web-interface-port
    --web-interface-addr

To see a list of all options, use the -h flag.

The samos.run script starts the samos client binary and opens the interface
in your browser with xdg-open.  It is not aware of any changes to samos client's
web interface configuration, you can override the url with SAMOS_WEB_URL or
by editing the samos.url file.

If there is no webpage available, try reloading the page. The page may have opened
before the samos client finished loading.
